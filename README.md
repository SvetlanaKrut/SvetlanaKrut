- 👋 Hi, I’m Svetlana
- 👀 I use and expand my knowledge of manual testing of web applications, desktop applications and mobile applications. I'm learning new testing tools.
- 🌱 I am a graduate of the Yandex Practicum QA engineer course. I gained theoretical and practical skills - analyzing requirements, drawing up mind maps, applying test design techniques, creating checklists and test cases. I practiced testing web applications using Charles and Devtools, tested APIs using Postman, wrote SQL queries and worked with databases.
Currently I am actively collaborating with the Yandex Workshop.
Completed a three-month project to create an MVP “Web service for nearby hospitals and clinics”, in a cross-team with developers and designers.
I’m starting to work in a project to test the existing website of the Charitable Foundation Svet.Children, in the format of a free internship.
